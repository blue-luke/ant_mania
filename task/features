Implemented
Ants move across limited map
Ants fight at same position

Next
Fighting is only text based, doesn't remove position. Need position object
Fighting doesn't remove ants. Need map object?

To be implemented
Position needs to be destroyed (removed from available hashes)
Ants need to be destroyed (no longer available for fights)
Whole map needs to be loaded
CLI allowing N to be passed

Assumptions
Can ants only start in positions where there are no other ants?
What happens if 3 ants meet? Do two fight, or all 3?
What happens if 4 ants meet? Do two fight, or all 4?
